        <p><h3>Biography</h3></p>
    	<p><h4>Gabe Cleto is...</h4></p>
        <p><h5>Gabe Cleto is a graphic designer and photographer from Las Vegas Nevada. He earned his Bachelors Degree in Graphic Design in 2013 in the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Currently, Gabe Cleto helps the needy and saves lives when the needy needs his help... which is like all the time. The world is a pretty dangerous world, so there will always be work for Gabe to do. Too bad it's mostly probono and no one really wants to pay for this type of work. <br><br>
        On a brighter note, Gabe also enjoys playing loads of StarCraft 2. Despite not being able to compete at a competitive nature because the people in Grandmaster league are really crazy and it is no longer fun when it turns into a job, he still enjoys watching the pros play and often takes advice and strategies from them. I hope this filler text was entertaining to you all. Please donate to Gabe's rainy day fund since he is graduating and needs a job.</p><h5>
